          <h4>Biography:</h4>
          <p>
            Travel has been in my blood from the time I was 6 years old when my
            family camped all over Europe for the summer. I have visited the
            Great Wall of China, the pyramids in Egypt, Iguazu Falls Argentina,
            Machu Pichu Peru, Lake Titicaca Peru, Europe, cruising around the
            Greek Islands and Cape Horn, Rome, Belize, Milford South New Zealand
            and the beautiful rivers of Europe. I’ve lived in Colombia for 3
            years and Chile for 1 ½ years.
