                    <h3>The Bahamas from Miami, FL - As low as $129/night</h3>
                    <p>You know the name, the laid-back attitude and where to find them, but you’ll just have to visit The Bahamas to truly appreciate this classic cruise destination. On this 700-strong string of sun-splashed islands dotting the blue Atlantic, the living’s easy. (And it’s not bad on a Bahamas cruise either!) Enjoy sailing, snorkeling, strolling pearly pink-sand beaches, and swimming through crystalline turquoise seas on a Bahamas cruise.</p>

                    <h3>Western Carribbean from Tampa, FL - As low as $219/night</h3>
                    <p>We don’t have proof, but evidence suggests that the Caribbean was made for cruising. This evidence is all around you — you’ll find in the Caribbean air, the sand and the water. And with more than 5,000 islands and cays spread across this amazing region, there’s a lot of paradise to see. So how do you choose where to visit on a Caribbean cruise? We recommend you just go and see for yourself! Best of all, the mild climate means it doesn’t even matter what time of year you go.</p>
